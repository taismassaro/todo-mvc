1. Add todos
2. Edit todos by double-clicking
3. Delete todos
4. Check/Uncheck todos
5. Filters for complete/active todos
6. Counts how many todos are left
7. Todos are saved to LocalStorage

Code a pixel-perfect copy in HTML/CSS, then implement the functionality in JavaScript.

After that, pick something new or even a harder version TodoMVC.

- Allow users to sign in with GitHub
- Save users’ todos in a database
- Show them next time they log in
- Fall back to LocalStorage if they don’t want to sign in
