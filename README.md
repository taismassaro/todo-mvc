1. Add todos :white_check_mark:
2. Edit todos by double-clicking :white_check_mark:
3. Delete todos :white_check_mark:
4. Check/Uncheck todos :white_check_mark:
5. Filters for complete/active todos :white_check_mark:
6. Counts how many todos are left :white_check_mark:
7. Todos are saved to LocalStorage :white_check_mark:

Code a pixel-perfect copy in HTML/CSS, then implement the functionality in JavaScript.

After that, pick something new or even a harder version TodoMVC.

- Allow users to sign in with GitHub
- Save users’ todos in a database
- Show them next time they log in
- Fall back to LocalStorage if they don’t want to sign in
